## The Golden Rule:

🦸 🦸‍♂️ `Stop starting and start finishing.` 🏁

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Making a plan

1. **Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"**
1. **Once you have a drawing, name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision**
1. **For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this?**
1. **Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How"**
1. **Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, on load etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. Does any state change?**
1. **Think about how to validate each of your features according to a Definition of Done**
1. **Consider what features _depend_ on what other features. Use this dependency logic to figure out what order to complete tasks.**
